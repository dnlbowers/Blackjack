Redo color grid with new colors

# **Blackjack**
## **Site Overview**
Blackjack is a classic game dating back to around the 1700s. This game is enjoyed in many forms, from casinos worldwide to kids on the school bus looking to pass the time with a simple game of cards.

My current line of work is in the online casino industry. Hence, I wanted to create something relevant to my daily life. I intend this game to be a bit of harmless fun, to be used to pass the time, much like those days spent on the back of the bus playing for pennies.

## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience:**
* Adults who enjoy playing blackjack for the strategy but do not want to spend money playing.
* Fans of the classic card game blackjack.
* People are looking for an enjoyable way to spend some time away from a more concentrated task.
* Visually impaired people who still want to join in the fun of playing blackjack for free online.

### **User Stories:**
As a user, I want to: -
* Be able to play blackjack for free without the need to break the bank if I lose.
* Be able to navigate around the game controls and menu with as few clicks as possible.
* Use keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse.
* Track the progress of each round in some way.
* Find a clear explanation of the game rules and how to play.
* Be able to toggle the sound on and off.
* Adjust the color settings of the game table and surrounding area.

### **Site Aims:**
1. To provide a free version of blackjack that anyone can enjoy.

1. Be fully accessible to the visually impaired.

1. Ensure the site is easy to navigate.

1. Provide simple to understand instructions.

1. To enable the user to use the keyboard as much as possible should they choose to.

1. Provide a record of all wins, loses, and draws.

1. Provide feedback to the user after each round.

1. To be an enjoyable distraction to fill the user's time.
   
### **How Will This Be Achieved:**
1. The game will be free to use, and no sign up required.

1. Ensuring the use of semantic elements, alternate text, and aria labels where appropriate.

1. The landing page will be the main menu. Access to the main menu can also be done throughout the game using the menu button or pressing m on the keyboard. This menu will contain links to:
        * Game rules.
        * Game options menu. 
        * Card table.
        * Responsible Gaming Statement.

1. The relevant game rules are divided into clearly marked sections of the rules sub-menu. 

1. By indicating keyboard shortcuts on each control button.
 
1. After each round, the relevant tally will be increased by one.

1. Upon the conclusion of each round, a modal will appear on the screen with the result.

1. Providing a simple, appealing, and accessible interface.
   
### **Wireframes:**
To give my project structure and work out the best intended flow of information, I created the below wireframes as a guide.
    
    *Mobile Wireframes:
        * [Game Table and Main Menu.](docs/wireframes/mobile-gameboard-menu.png)
    
    *Desktop Wireframes:
        * [Desktop Game Table.](docs/wireframes/desktop-gameboard.png)
        * [Desktop Main Menu.](docs/wireframes/desktop-menu.png)

Along the way the design and menu options have changed slightly in order to improve he user experience of the app. The changes included: -

* User controls and score board switched positions in order to make the game control more accessible for the user.
* The removal of the contact option in the menu in favor of social link in the footer.
* I decided it was better overall visually if all game elements with contained within the main area of the app. The only exceptions to the were: 
    * Social media links to gitHub and linked in.
    * The title and surrounding logo's.
    * MEnu button visible from the game table but hidden when within the menu itself.

Since this for this project wireframes are not required and were used only to structure my own creative process I did not feel the need to pre-design each of the sub-menus in turn. For this reason I have omitted them. 

### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the app's color scheme, I first began with the classic green table then worked outwards from there. My was to create the regal feeling of a casino, whilst keeping my contrast scores as high as possible for accessibility purposes.
 
I have created the below color grid using [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%0D%0A%23fff%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A%23000.%0D%0A%23bf953f%2C%20%0D%0A%23fcf6ba%2C%0D%0A%23b38728%0D%0A%20%23b38728%2C%0D%0A%23fbf5b7%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A%23d3d3d3%0D%0A%238B0000%2C%0D%0A%23ff0000%2C%0D%0A%23FFD700%2C%0D%0A%2300008B%2C%0D%0A%234682b4%2C%0D%0A%2300bfff%2C%0D%0A%234b0082%2C%0D%0A%23312b50%2C%0D%0A%23312b50%2C%0D%0A%23ee82ee%2C%0D%0A%23006400%2C%0D%0A%23008080%2C%0D%0A%2300FFBF%2C%20%20%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp)

### **Honorable mentions**
Mark - Helped me calm down enough to plan my basic flow. Mark is a man who has repeatedly helped me and my family in more ways than I could ever decribe and I am proud to have him as a brother in law. 
Bim (use slack name not git hub) - Explained event listeners to me in a context I understood and gave me hope when it was lost. He was also constantly willing to lend an ear and help me beat out any issue I had without taking over. This mans teaching style is skillful and caring! I could not have managed to get through this project without him seeing my distress and making sure to keep an eye on me from there on. He even pressured me into avoiding my avoidance and I am so glad he did.
Richard - Mentor who gave me faith in myself throughout and calmed me down in moment of panic
Simen - Was on my first call with BIM and also aided the tutorial on event listeners. Simen has repeatedly stepped in to guide me along the way and I am lucky to have such a skilled alumini on my side. 
matt - A true friend and confidant. Matt is always close to the keyboard if I need him. His webinar of CSS positioning gave me the aha moment I needed when trying to work out how to fan the playing cards. Since I first met Matt in a random slack call I lnew he was someone I would be able to relate too easily. This man is turely one to watch in the realm of coding. 
daisy - Within seconds of me posting the question about the W3c assesability guidelines for accordion menus she jump into a call with me and helped me rubber duck it out. She is truely a super women with a keyboard and I am luck to have had her be to willing to assist me.
