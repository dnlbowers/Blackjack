# Site Overview
Black jack is a classic game dating back to around the 1700's. This game is enjoyed by many in casinos across the world and well as kids on the school bus looking to pass the time with a simple game of cards.

My current line of work in in the online casino industry and hence I wanted to create something relevant to may daily life. My rendition it just a bit of harmless fun to pass the time much like those day spent on the back of the bus playing for pennies.
